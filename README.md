# zig-webgl
WebGL 1 bindings for Zig.

The bindings consist of two files: one Zig file and one JavaScript file. These files are generated based on handwritten sources and some WebGL functions are missing.

To generate, run `sh generate.sh`. The generated files are included in this repository for convenience.
